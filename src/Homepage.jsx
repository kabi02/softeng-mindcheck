                Welcome to MindCheck! As part of our commitment to help clinical evaluation and research, we created a website and evaluation that incorporates the American Psychological Association (APA)'s DSM-5-TR measures. These measures have been specifically developed to be administered during the initial patient interview and to effectively evaluate mental stability. <br /><br />
                It is important to note that these assessment measures should not be used as the sole basis for making a clinical diagnosis. Instead, they are intended to be utilized as potentially valuable tools to enhance clinical decision-making. Instructions, scoring information, and interpretation guidelines are readily available to assist clinicians and users.<br /><br />
                By leveraging these patient assessment measures, we aim to aid the field of clinical evaluation, promote evidence-based decision-making, and ultimately enhance the overall quality of mental health evaluation. </p>
